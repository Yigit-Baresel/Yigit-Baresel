-  I am a newly graduated industrial engineer
-  Iâ€™m interested in data analysis
-  I am looking for a job where I can improve myself and learn new things
- As an industrial engineer, we took statistics and software courses in our lessons. I decided that these subjects were more suitable for me and I continue to work on it.
- Professions that I think I will do with pleasure and long-term in my business life are data analyst, business analyst and software developer.
- I continue to develop myself in Python, JAVA and SQL languages.
